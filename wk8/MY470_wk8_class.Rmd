### Getting Started: Installing R and RStudio

Try knitting the [`TestRMarkdown.Rmd`](TestRMarkdown.Rmd) document.  This means that you will need to have:

a) Installed R.  (Preferably 3.6.1)
b) Installed RStudio.
c) Installed the **knitr** and **rmarkdown** packages.  (When you open the `TestRMarkdown.Rmd` file, you should see a button for "Knit".  When you click on that, if the required packages are not yet installed, you should be prompted to install them.)
d) When this is successful, you will have converted a mixture of Markdown and R code into an HTML document.  This is an important step, since the homework is in Rmarkdown.

For the rest of the class, you will need to open the file `MY470_wk8_class.Rmd` and work by modifying and knitting that (this!) file. 

For your assignment, which you can find in `MY470_wk8_exercise.Rmd` in the assignment repository, you will need to follow a similar procedure. We will mark your responses based on the content of the .html file that you generate.

### R basics

Open RStudio and explore the programme. Make sure you can identify the `console`, the script editor, the `environment` window, the `packages` window and the `help` window.
  
Use the code below to create a vector of the integers 1 through 5.  Examine the [RMarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) code block below.  This is the R equivalent of a Jupyter notebook "cell".

```{r}
my_vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_vec)
```

In RStudio, you can insert code blocks in R (or Python) using the "Insert" button in the Source pane, or by typing the code fence triple backticks and the the `{r}` manually.

Multiply each element of your vector by 3, and assign the output to a new object. `print` the values of your new object.

```{r}
my_new_vec <- my_vec * 3
print(my_new_vec)
```

(A) Add together the two objects that you have created so far, `print`ing the result. Note that R operates on vectors element-wise.

```{r}
# add your code here
print(my_new_vec + my_vec)
```

(B) Create a logical vector of length five, again using the `c()` function. Make sure that you have a mix of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values in the vector. Use the logical vector to subset the numeric vector that you created in question 2 and `print` the result.

```{r}
# add your code here
log_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
my_vec[log_vec]
```

(C) Subset to just the first two elements of the numeric vector that you created in question 2 and assign the result to have the name `my_short_vector`. Then, print that object.

```{r}
# add your code here
my_short_vector <- my_vec[1:2]
```

(D) Find the function to list all objects in your current environment. Can you see all the objects we just created?

```{r}
# add your code here
ls()
```

### Working with data frames

(E) We will now work with a dataset that comes with R, called `state.x77`. The code below will add it to your workspace. Then, use the `str` and `summary` functions to examine this data frame. How do you interpret the output?

```{r}
df <- data.frame(state.x77)
df$state <- rownames(df)
str(state.x77)
summary(state.x77)
# add your code here
```

(F) Find the state with the highest and lowest population size. You will need to use the `order` function. You can check `?order` to find the documentation for this function.

```{r}
# add your code here
ordered = order(state.x77)

```

(G) Finally, we will study the association between income per capita and education (% of high-school graduates). Compute a correlation coefficient between these two variables using the `cor` function. Then, create a scatterplot to illustrate visually this relationship using `plot`. As before, check the documentation for these functions to guide your work. If you want to see more information about the dataset, you can also type `?state.x77`.

```{r}
# add your code here
```
